Barghouth Dark Store - Local images and rich content
Files:
- index.html, shop.html, product.html, checkout.html, plans.html, about.html, contact.html
- css/style.css (dark theme)
- js/products.js (product data)
- js/site-dark.js (interactions)
- images/*.svg (local stylized bottle images)

How to use:
- Unzip and upload the folder to a static host (GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel).
- Open index.html to view. Product images are local SVGs to avoid broken-links.
- To change product images replace files in images/ and update products.js if needed.
